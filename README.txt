Linear Data Structures
 * Arrays: Store elements of the same data type in a contiguous memory block. Efficient for random access by index.
 * Linked Lists: Elements are not stored contiguously, but linked together using pointers. Offer flexibility for insertions and deletions.
 * Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure. Elements are added and removed from the top (think stack of plates).
 * Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure. Elements are added to the back and removed from the front (think queue line).
Non-Linear Data Structures
 * Trees: Hierarchical structure simulating a tree with nodes connected by edges. Useful for representing relationships.
 * Graphs: Model relationships between data elements as nodes connected by edges. Used for social networks, navigation systems, etc.
 * Hash Tables: Offer efficient association lookup. Store key-value pairs and use hashing to locate a value based on its key.
Other Data Structures (Only tensors and Enums are known to me)
 * Sets: Collections of unique elements, allowing for efficient membership testing and duplicate removal.
 * Tries: Designed for efficient string searching and retrieval, especially prefixes.
 * Bloom Filters: Probabilistic data structures for space-efficient membership testing.
 * Heaps: Tree-based structures that enforce a specific order (min-heap or max-heap). Useful for priority queues.
 * Disjoint-Set Forests: Efficiently track relationships between elements in a set.
 * Fenwick Trees: Efficiently compute prefix sums within an array.
 * Segment Trees: Efficiently answer range queries on an array.
 * Tensors: Generalize matrices to higher dimensions. Useful for representing multidimensional data.
 * Enums (Enumeration Types): User-defined data types consisting of a set of named constants. Provide a more readable and maintainable way to represent a fixed set of values.
